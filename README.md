Encrypt text using 256 bits key Advanced Encryption Standard  
  
Course Project: Created a GUI application written in Python for encrypting text using 256 bits key Advanced Encryption Standard.
The PyCryptodome package was used to provide cryptography functions. Tkinter was used to create the GUI. User
enters the text to be encrypted along with a key of any length which is converted to a 256 bits key using SHA-256.
After encryption they have the option to copy the encrypted text to clipboard for use elsewhere.
